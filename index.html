    <h1>This work was presented to you by <s>some lazy</s> young and inexperienced HTML5 trainee.</h1>

    <h2>Nothing really special included. Just tags practicing and studying.</h2>
    <h3>This text was inserted between <u>heading3 tags</u>.</h3>
    <h4>This text was inserted between <u>heading4 tags</u>.</h4>
    <h5>This text was inserted between <u>heading5 tags</u>.</h5>
    <h6>This text was inserted between <u>heading6 tags</u>.</h6>
    <p>...and I was unable to put text between heading7 tags due to HTML5 limitations.</p>
    <p>Not all of the tags I wanted to put here are actually supported by HTML5. That including ones like <u>Center</u> and <u>Align</u> tags.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I just used <u>brake tag</u>. You could see it by pressing <b>CTRL+U</b> combination in your browser. Well at least in Google Chrome as I know.</p>
    <p>Here we have a <a href="http://montrealseogroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/link-building.jpg">link</a>. This is will lead you to a picture of a link.</p>
    <p>Also I don't really understand difference between <b><u>bold tag</u></b> and <strong><u>strong tag</u></strong>. What's that actually all about? <i>Importance</i>?</p>
    <br>
    <h3>↓ You can read some random quote here, which was written including combined tags ↓</h3>
    <p><q>If you're going to San Francisco, be sure to wear <i><b>some flowers</b></i> in your hair.</q></p>
    <br>
        <p><em>This text was written with the use of <u>emphasized tags</u>.</em></p>
        <p><i>...and this text was written with the use of <u>italic tags</u>.</i></p>
        <p>Those tags seems similar. But according to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3Schools</a>, they're actually not.</p>
        <br>
        <p><u>This text was written with a little help of <b>Underlined tags</b></u>. </p>
        <p>Once that tag was deprecated, but later it was redefined in HTML5. Cool story.</p>
        <br>
        <p><small>Here we have small text which is indicating some law and copyright information and which is using <u>Small tags</u></small>.</p>
        <p>Usually small texts like that can be seen right in the end of the site to attract as little much attention as they could.</p> 
        <br>
        <h3>Here we have a star, drawed by using <u>SVG tags</u>.</h3>
        <svg width="300" height="200">
<polygon points="100,10 40,180 190,60 10,60 160,180"
style="fill:red;stroke:black;stroke-width:5;fill-rule:evenodd;"/> </svg>
        <br>
        <h3>Here's some audio.</h3>
        <p>I can honestly say that I picked first random legaly unprotected file, so apparently nobody can sue me for that.</p>
        <audio src="Kalimba.mp3" controls="controls">
</audio>
        <br>
        <h3>Also here's some video</h3>
        <p>Same story as with uploading some audio</p>
        <video src="Nature.mp4" controls="controls" width="640" height="480">
</video>
        <h2>That's all for now.</h2> 
        <h3>Now I'll pray that all this written stuff somehow will pass through the <strong>Validator</strong>. </h3>
